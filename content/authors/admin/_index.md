### Hi, I'm Marshall. I'm glad you're here.

Seriously, I am happy you came to visit. I love building things that people want to look at even if they only stop by for a minute or two. 

### About me
I'm a Pythonista, R Pirate, Machine Learning Enthusiast, SQL Monkey, and Data Nerd. I'm also an expert with some BI tools like Tableau and Alteryx but I tell everyone I hate using them because I think coding is more fun.
